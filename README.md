## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Install Claude Code CLI**
3. **Make scripts executable**: `chmod +x */*.sh`
4. **Start with ADAS**: `./evolution/adas-meta-agent.sh`
5. **Explore examples** in each script's README

## 📚 Documentation

## 🌐 MCP Server
A minimal TypeScript server in `mcp-server/` exposes the ADAS Meta Agent via a REST API. Run it with `npm start` in that folder and POST to `/design-agent` with a domain and iteration count. The server stores results in memory so you can fetch them again via `GET /design-agent/{sessionId}`.

Each script includes:
- Detailed README with usage examples
- Configuration options and parameters
- Integration guides for development workflows
- Troubleshooting and FAQ sections

## 🤝 Contributing
